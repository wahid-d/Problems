# Find the Characters Counterpart Char Code

Create a function that takes a single character **string** as an argument and returns the char code of its *lowercased* / *uppercased* counterpart.

### Examples
```cs
Given that:
  - "A" char code is: 65
  - "a" char code is: 97

CounterpartCharCode("A") ➞ 97

CounterpartCharCode("a") ➞ 65
```
### Notes
* The argument will always be a single character.
* Not all inputs will have a counterpart (e.g. numbers), in which case return the inputs char code.
