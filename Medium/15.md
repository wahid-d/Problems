# Basic E-Mail Validation

Create a function that accepts a string, checks if it's a valid email address and returns either `true` or `false`, depending on the evaluation.

* The string must contain an `@` character.
* The string must contain a `.` character.
* The @ must have at least one character in front of it.
e.g. **`e@edabit.com`** is valid while **`@edabit.com`** is invalid.
* The `.` and the` @` must be in the appropriate places.
e.g. "hello.email@com" is invalid while **`john.smith@email.com`** is valid.

If the string passes these tests, it's considered a valid email address.

### Examples
```cs
ValidateEmail("@gmail.com") ➞ false

ValidateEmail("hello.gmail@com") ➞ false

ValidateEmail("gmail") ➞ false

ValidateEmail("hello@gmail") ➞ false

ValidateEmail("hello@edabit.com") ➞ true
```
### Notes
* You can solve this challenge with `RegEx`, but it's intended to be solved with logic.
* Solutions using `RegEx` will be accepted but frowned upon 🙁
