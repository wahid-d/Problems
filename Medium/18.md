# Compounding Letters

Create a function that takes a string and returns a new string with each new character accumulating by `+1`. Separate each set with a dash.

### Examples
```cs
Accum("abcd") ➞ "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"

Accum("RqaEzty") ➞ "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"

Accum("cwAt") ➞ "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
```
### Notes
* Capitalize the first letter of each set.
* All tests contain valid strings with alphabetic characters `(a-z, A-Z)`.
