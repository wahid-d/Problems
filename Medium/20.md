# A Pirate's Tale

Captain Hook and his crew are currently resting at Origin Shore. They are about to embark on their next adventure to an undisclosed location **`(x, y)`** to find treasure.

Captain Hook's ship can only move exactly `north`, `south`, `east` or `west`. It takes exactly 1 day for the ship to travel 1 unit in one of the four cardinal directions.

*`After every 5 days, the crew will take one day of rest.`*

Given the location of the treasure, find out how long it takes for Captain Hook and his crew to find the treasure. The ship is currently at coordinate **`(0, 0)`**.

```cs
// NumberOfDay(treasureX, treasureY);
NumberOfDays(3,5) => 9 days
// Since: 3 days east + 2 days north (5 days passed) + 1 day of rest + 3 days north

NumberOfDays(-4, -1) => 5 days
// Since 4 days west + 1 day south
```

### Examples
```cs
NumberOfDays(10, 10) ➞ 23

NumberOfDays(3, 3) ➞ 7

NumberOfDays(-10, -9) ➞ 22

NumberOfDays(-1, -2) ➞ 3
```
### Notes

# **Advanced**

Now imagine that The Captain Hook isn't at origin. His is ship somewhere at **`(shipX, shipY)`** coordinate.

So, the method would become: 
 **`NumberOfDays(shipX, shipY, treasureX, treasureY);`**

* All the rules are same except that the ship coordinates will also be given.
