# Count Ones in Binary Representation of Integer

Count the amount of ones in the *`binary representation`* of an integer. So for example, since `12` is `1100` in binary, the return value should be `2`.

### Examples
```cs
CountOnes(0) ➞ 0

CountOnes(100) ➞ 3

CountOnes(999) ➞ 8
```
### Notes
* The input will always be a valid integer (number).
